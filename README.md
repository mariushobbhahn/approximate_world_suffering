# approximate_world_suffering
A back-of-the-envelope attempt to approximate the suffering that exists around the world. If you want to improve my estimates or want to collaborate just drop me a mail at marius.hobbhahn[at]gmail.com

The first project is to estimate human suffering and iteratively improve my model

The second project estimates the suffering inflicted on animals due to factory farming. This is harder since you need to quantify animal suffering. 

The third project estimates the suffering caused by wild animal suffering. This is the hardest because we don't know a lot about it.
